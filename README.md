## 💡 About Me

I'm a passionate backend developer with 1+ year of professional experience in building real-world, scalable solutions using:

- 🚀 **Java + Spring Boot** for robust backend development
- 🧠 **SQL & PostgreSQL** for designing efficient, normalized databases
- 🐍 **Python** for scripting and automation tasks
- 🌐 **JavaScript (Angular/Node.js)** for full-stack delivery when needed

Currently working remotely at **OneIT**, where I engineer backend systems for enterprise applications — including Learning Management Systems, payment integration modules (Eway, Chargebee), and dynamic dashboards.

I take pride in writing clean, modular code, solving real problems, and continuously learning to stay ahead of the curve.
